   <title>2.2.4 What You Should Expect from Your Employer or Sponsor</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <lcInstruction>
         <p>Once the Apprenticeship Committee selects an applicant to be an apprentice, the employer or sponsor hires the apprentice. The apprentice’s job has the same potential for career advancement as a non-apprentice employee. In return, the employer or sponsor requires the apprentice to make satisfactory progress in OJL and related classroom instruction throughout the duration of the apprenticeship program.</p>
      </lcInstruction>
      <section>
         <p>The employer or sponsor agrees not to employ the apprentice in a way that may violate the apprenticeship standards. The employer or sponsor may also pay a share of the cost of operating the apprenticeship program.</p>
