   <title>2.1.3 Loyalty</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <lcInstruction>
         <p>As an employee, you expect your employer or sponsor to look out for your interests, keep you steadily employed, and promote you as job openings occur. Your employers and sponsors, in turn, have a right to expect your loyalty in return. Remember, however, that loyalty cannot be demanded from someone; it can only be earned.</p>

         <p>Loyalty means different things to different people, but in a professional setting, loyalty usually means the following:</p>
      </section>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Keeping the interests of your employer or sponsor in mind</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Speaking well of your employer or sponsor to others</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Keeping any minor troubles strictly within the job site</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Respecting the confidentiality of all matters that pertain to your employer’s or sponsor’s business</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <section>
         <p>A loyal employee fulfills commitments and meets obligations. Never go to work for someone else without first ensuring that you have met all of your commitments to your current employer or sponsor. A prospective employer will be impressed with your commitment and be willing to wait for you. If not, you might want to reconsider whether you should work for that company.</p>
