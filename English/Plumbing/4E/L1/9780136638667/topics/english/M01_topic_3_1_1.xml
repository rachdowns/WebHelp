         <p>An employee with a positive attitude contributes to others’ productivity by setting an example. You can probably recall a situation where you had to work with someone who was complaining and slacking off. Do you remember how difficult and unpleasant it was to work in a situation like that? Try to keep that in mind when you are on the job, and ask yourself: Am I demonstrating a positive attitude?</p>
         <p>A positive work environment not only leads to greater productivity, but also makes the job more enjoyable. Employers pay attention to your attitude. Supervisors see your attitude in your approach to the job, in your reactions to instructions, and in the way you handle problems, especially unforeseen ones.</p>
