   <title>2.2.2 Youth Apprenticeship Program</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <lcInstruction>
         <p>The concept of apprenticeship training goes back thousands of years. Over that time, the basic principles of apprenticeship training have not changed. Apprentices learn their craft from those who have mastered it. Although some theory is presented in the classroom, it is always presented in a way that helps trainees understand the purpose behind the skill to be learned. The NCCER training curriculum follows this proven approach.</p>

      <section>
         <p>Youth Apprenticeship Programs allow students to begin their apprentice training while they are still in high school. Students entering a plumbing program in the 11th grade may complete as much as one year of the NCCER four-year program by their high school graduation. In addition, the program, in cooperation with local craft employers, allows students to work in the trade and earn money while they are still in school.</p>
         <p>This training program is similar to the one used by NCCER-accredited training sponsors across the country. With your official transcripts, you can enter the second year of the program wherever it is offered. You may also apply these credits to a two- or four-year college that offers degree or certificate programs in the construction profession.</p>
         <p>You may become an employee at age 16, but the US Department of Labor (DOL) limits your work to occupations that are not specifically defined as hazardous. Hazardous jobs include such things as explosives manufacturing, mining, meatpacking, and power-driven sheet metal work. You may work on a project site as an apprentice or journey plumber when you are 16, but only if you are enrolled and in good standing in a plumbing apprenticeship program.</p>
         <p>You must be at least 18 before you can legally work in a hazardous occupation. When you have graduated from your apprenticeship program, you can enter the industry at a higher level and with more pay than people who are just starting the apprenticeship program.</p>

         <title>Child Labor Laws</title>
         <p>Federal law establishes the minimum standards for workers under age 18. Some municipal jurisdictions may enforce stricter regulations. Employers are required to abide by the laws that apply to them.</p>
         <p>The Child Labor Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act forbid employers from using illegal child labor, and also forbid companies from doing business with any other business that does. DOL investigates alleged abuses of the law. In such cases, employers have to provide proof of age for their employees.</p>
         <p>In addition to the Child Labor Provisions, employers in the construction trades are required to follow DOL’s Child Labor Bulletin No. 101, Child Labor Requirements in Nonagricultural Occupations Under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Bulletin No. 101 does the following:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>Explains the coverage of the Child Labor Provisions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Identifies minimum age standards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Lists the exemptions from the Child Labor Provisions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Sets employment standards for 14- and 15-year-old workers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Defines the work that can be performed in hazardous occupations</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Provides penalties for violations of the Child Labor Provisions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Recommends the use of age certificates for employees</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
