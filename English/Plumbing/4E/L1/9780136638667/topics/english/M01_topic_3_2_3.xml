   <title>2.2.3 Apprenticeship Standards</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <lcInstruction>
         <p>All apprenticeship standards call for certain work-related training, or OJL. OJL is broken down into specific tasks in which the apprentice receives hands-on training. Each task requires a specified number of hours. The total number of hours in a plumbing apprenticeship is traditionally 8,000, which amounts to four years of training. In a competency-based program, this time may be shortened by testing out of specific tasks through a series of performance exams.</p>
      </lcInstruction>
      <section>
         <p>In a traditional program, you may complete the required OJL at the rate of 2,000 hours per year. If you are laid off or get sick, it may take longer.</p>
         <p>Sponsors need to receive, log in, and report an apprentice’s time records, and have them reviewed by the federal government and/or the state apprenticeship program. Therefore, apprentices should keep accurate and up-to-date time records; after the first 144 classroom hours and 1,000 hours of related work, and then for each subsequent 1,000 hours, the standards entitle an apprentice to a pay increase.</p>
         <p>Apprentices may not always receive classroom instruction and OJL at the same time. Apprentices with special job experience or other coursework may obtain credit toward their classroom requirements. This reduces the time they are required to spend in the classroom while meeting the 8,000-hour OJL requirement. These special cases depend on the type of program and its regulations and standards.</p>
         <p>For those entering an apprenticeship program, a high school or technical school education is desirable, with courses in plumbing, shop, mechanical drawing, and general mathematics. Manual dexterity, good physical condition, and a good sense of balance are important. It is essential to be able to solve math problems quickly and accurately and to work closely with others.</p>
         <p>If you want to become an apprentice, you must submit to the Apprenticeship Committee certain information, which may include the following (the actual requirements may vary by state):</p>
