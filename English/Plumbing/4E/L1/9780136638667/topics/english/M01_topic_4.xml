         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>History has taught us that plumbing is vital to public health, safety, and comfort. Today, the plumbing profession is more important than ever. As the worldâ€™s population grows, the built environment is expanding to accommodate it. The world needs more skilled and experienced plumbers to ensure that the public stays safe, healthy, and comfortable.</p>
         <p>The plumbing profession relies upon a range of skills and a broad base of knowledge. Plumbers are responsible for installing and maintaining a wide variety of supply and drainage systems. Plumbers carefully follow local codes and regulations to ensure that systems are safe.</p>
         <p>Because the plumbing profession is always evolving, successful plumbers never stop learning about new techniques, materials, tools, and standards. In addition to staying current with their technical skills and knowledge, successful plumbers also follow high ethical standards. They maintain a positive attitude, are honest and loyal, and are responsible for their actions. They cooperate with their teammates and supervisors, pay attention to rules and regulations, and are always prompt and reliable employees.</p>
         <p>As an apprentice embarking on your plumbing career, you have the right to expect a quality education that serves you well. Your employer or sponsor and your Apprenticeship Committee should do their best to ensure that you are well prepared for the responsibilities you will take on. Ultimately, though, the decision is yours as to whether you will try hard to become the best professional plumber that you can be.</p>
