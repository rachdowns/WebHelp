   <title>2.1.2 Honesty</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <lcInstruction>
         <p>Honesty and personal integrity are important traits of the successful professional. Honesty means more than just telling the truth and never cheating or stealing. It also means doing a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay. It means holding up your side of a bargain. It means backing up promises with action.</p>

         <p>You should take pride in performing a job well and you should never cut corners. Never lie to clients, supervisors, or co-workers. Respect the property of others. Ensure that the tools and materials belonging to your employer (or sponsor), customers, and other trades are not damaged or stolen from the shop or the job site. Treat their property with the same respect that you give to your own.</p>
         <p>Your reputation will always precede you. A reputation for honesty and integrity will make employers want to hire you because they know that you can be trusted. On the other hand, if you lie, cheat, or steal, that reputation will precede you wherever you apply for work and your career will suffer accordingly.</p>
         <p>If you want to be gainfully employed, earn a good salary, and be well regarded by teammates and supervisors, then you should start by being honest. It’s that simple.</p>
