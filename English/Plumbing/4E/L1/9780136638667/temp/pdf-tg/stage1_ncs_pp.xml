Plumbing systems allow people to have safe, healthy, fresh water for drinking, washing, cooking, and many other uses. Additionally, plumbing reduces the spread of disease by safely draining away wastewater that contains harmful organisms. Improved sanitation contributes to longer life expectancies for men, women, and children. Plumbing systems also allow people to fight fires, water their lawns, fill their pools, and perform many daily activities.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">Archaeologists have determined that rudimentary plumbing systems were in use as early as 2900 BC. Earthenware pipes, masonry sewers, water closets, and drainage systems have been found in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) to prove this.</p>
      </lcInstruction>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">In 312 BC, the Romans began bringing water into Rome through an <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_aqueduct" type="dlentry">aqueduct </term> system, or a system of
            channels used to carry water. Most aqueducts were open, stone-lined trenches that used
            gravity to move water downhill. The more famous arched aqueducts were not nearly as
            commonly used as the simpler trench systems. By 100 AD, the aqueduct system was so
            advanced that Rome built and maintained public bathhouses and fountains throughout the
            city. The aqueducts were also used to drain wastes and discharge them into the river
            downstream from the city.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Archaeologists and historians believe that the widespread use of lead pipe in ancient Roman cities may have contributed to the downfall of the Roman Empire. Lead is harmful to the brain, the nervous system, and vital organs such as the liver. Water carried through lead pipes may have gradually poisoned many people in the Roman Empire.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">The Romans also gave us the word that we use today to describe people who install and maintain water supply and waste systems. The Latin word for lead is <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_plumbum" type="dlentry">plumbum</term>, and a person who worked with lead was called a <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_plumbarius" type="dlentry">plumbarius</term>. Over the centuries, this ancient word has come down to us as a word you know very well: <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_plumber" type="dlentry">plumber</term>.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">During the fifth century AD, the Goths invaded Rome and the Roman Empire came to an end. Roman cities and their infrastructure fell into disrepair. Much of the science, math, and technology of the Roman and Greek golden age were gradually forgotten. The period after the fall of Rome (500 AD to 1400 AD) is often referred to as the Dark Ages because of the social and cultural decline that resulted from this loss.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">During that time, people neglected sanitation and hygiene. They emptied sewage into the streets and did not store or prepare their food in a healthful way. As a result, more people died from disease than from wars during those years. Some historians estimate that one-third of the population of Europe died from diseases spread by unsanitary living conditions and led to widespread epidemics like the Bubonic plague and smallpox, which killed hundreds of thousands across the continent.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">By the mid-1300s, however, sanitation began to return to the cities of Europe. The first water supply pipe was laid in London during that time. The ancient baths and spas built by the Romans in England were put to use again during the sixteenth century. During that time, plumbing re-emerged as a profession. In 1625, the first apprenticeship laws for plumbing were enacted in England. Other countries began to develop water supply systems. A new era of sanitary awareness slowly emerged.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">One of the first known water closets was built in England in 1596 by a godson of Queen Elizabeth I, Sir John Harrington. However, it was another 200 years before the use of this invention became widespread. In 1775, Alexander Cumming invented the S-trap, the precursor of the toilet traps used today. Three years later, Joseph Bramah patented an improved version of Cumming’s device that incorporated two hinged valves. The original is still in use today in the House of Lords in London’s Parliament building. In 1848, England passed the National Public Safety Act, which served as model legislation for the rest of the world. The Act required every house to have sanitary facilities, whether a flush toilet or an outhouse.</p>

         <title class="- topic/title " id="d1e1813">Invention of Flush Toilets</title>
         <p class="- topic/p ">London plumber Thomas Crapper has been credited with the invention of the self-contained flush toilet. He was a plumber who was responsible for many innovations in his profession. During the late nineteenth century, he was granted patents for everything from improvements to drains to manhole covers to pipe joints. Around the same time, the first “modern” toilet appeared: a U-bend siphoning system to flush the pan where waste was deposited. Records show that the patent for this device was actually issued to Albert Giblin. It is likely that Crapper bought the patent rights from Giblin and then marketed the device himself. Crapper also served as the sanitary engineer for many members of the English royal family. Crapper’s association with the device may have originated during World War I, when soldiers used his name as a synonym for the toilets they saw as they passed through England on the way to the front lines in Europe.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">The plumbing profession received a royal boost in 1871. That year, Albert, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), almost died from typhus. Later investigation found that he had contracted the illness from contact with contaminated plumbing lines. The problem was corrected before they could cause more illness. A relieved and healthy Prince of Wales was later quoted as saying, “If I could not be a prince, I’d rather be a plumber.”</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Inspiration and innovation played a large role in the development of modern plumbing, but so did disasters. In 1666, after the Great Fire of London nearly destroyed the city, its citizens organized the first firefighting brigades and expanded the city’s water supply system. In the United States, deadly cholera epidemics in Philadelphia in 1793 and New York City in 1832 spurred construction of improved water supply systems. Earthquakes in California led to the modernization of municipal water systems there as well.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">The United States, in fact, has been responsible for many of the most notable advances in plumbing technology as well as in health and safety standards. Early settlers of North America brought with them the idea that baths and spas had curative properties. In 1652, Boston developed the first waterworks, using wood pipes for both firefighting and private use. In 1804, Philadelphia began using cast-iron piping for its water mains. By the mid-1800s, American homes often had outdoor privies supplied from wells or cisterns.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century, however, that the United States began to develop practical water and sewage systems. In 1857, an engineer named John Adams designed a sewer system for Brooklyn, New York. When it proved to be successful, he published his design, and other cities adopted it.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Wastewater treatment, however, still proved to be a problem for many cities. The first advancement in water purification was a slow sand filter installed in Richmond, Virginia, in 1832. Scientists later discovered that treating water supplies with <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_chlorine" type="dlentry">chlorine</term> (a heavy, greenish-yellow gas) would kill deadly bacteria. Following that discovery, cities in the United States and England began treating wastewater with chlorine.</p>
      </section>
      <note class="- topic/note " type="caution">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Caution</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Chlorine is highly toxic and corrosive. It also poses a serious fire risk. Chlorine will react violently with many chemicals, including water. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when working with liquid or gaseous chlorine. Always consult the material safety data sheet (MSDS) before moving, storing, or working with chlorine.</p>
      </note>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Despite these advancements, by the mid-1800s plumbing systems were neither complex enough nor large enough to keep up with the rapid growth of cities and populations spurred by the Industrial Revolution. By 1855, for example, Chicago still relied on individual wells and the Chicago River to support a population of 75,000. Densely populated factory cities in the United States threatened to deplete local water supplies and overwhelm rivers and streams with wastewater. The plumbing profession had to change with the times to meet these new demands.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">By the late nineteenth century, plumbing technology and practices were recognizably modern. Manufacturers and wholesale dealers of new plumbing devices sold them over the counter as separate components. They ignored the fact that these components would have to be combined and installed into a properly designed plumbing system in order to work. Dealers claimed no responsibility for the proper installation of plumbing systems. The results were predictable. People suffered from shoddy and unsafe plumbing systems that possibly made sanitary conditions worse instead of better. And plumbers were usually blamed—unfairly—when things went wrong. Plumbers had the knowledge and ability to install safe and efficient plumbing systems, but the manufacturers and dealers completely dominated the trade.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">Sanitation, along with medical science, continues to be largely responsible for the maintenance of public health. In the United States, great progress in the development of plumbing methods and technologies has been made since 1910. The reliability of traditional piping materials, such as copper and cast iron, has been dramatically improved. A new plastic compound called <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_thermoplastic" type="dlentry">thermoplastic</term> (which is soft and pliable when heated) and <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_thermoset" type="dlentry">thermoset</term> (which becomes solid when heated) have been developed. The physical properties of these plastics make them ideal for use in sanitary systems. <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_polyvinyl_chloride_pvc" type="dlentry">Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)</term>, developed in the 1930s, was the first plastic used in plumbing. PVC is a rigid pipe with high-impact strength that is manufactured from a thermoplastic material. The material has an indefinite life span under most conditions. Plumbers frequently use PVC in cold water systems. Manufacturers have also improved plumbing <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_fixtures" type="dlentry">fixtures</term>, which are devices that receive water from a water supply line. Common fixtures include sinks, faucets, shower stalls, and toilets.</p>

Before this, baths had been built in two separate sections: the tub itself and the surrounding apron. Kohler’s one-piece tub was much more sanitary and attractive. In 1926, Kohler introduced the electric sink, a combination of a conventional sink and electric dishwasher.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Other inventors established companies whose names are familiar to today’s plumbers. Al Moen, who held more than 75 patents, invented the single-handle mixing faucet. In 1906, William Sloan developed a flush valve in which water flows under pressure from the supply pipe directly to the fixture, so that it is always ready to be used. Halsey W. Taylor established the company that bears his name in 1912 to manufacture and sell hygienic drinking fountains.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">The goal of plumbers is to provide adequate piping systems that protect the health, safety, and comfort of the nation. Plumbers accomplish this goal in two ways:</p>

      </ul>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforce rules and regulations related to environmental issues. Laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Drinking Water Act have been passed to develop programs to help ensure the enforcement of these rules and regulations. State and local health agencies also establish their own complementary standards and regulations that apply to their jurisdictions. A plumber’s responsibility is to follow all of the rules and safeguards related to the work. Plumbers should also report any accidents or events that may be hazardous to health or to the environment.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">One of the biggest health and safety issues facing plumbers today is contamination caused by an improper <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_cross-connection" type="dlentry">cross-connection</term> between plumbing systems. A cross-connection is an arrangement between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system in which an accidental pressure differential between the two systems causes backflow of contaminated water into the freshwater system. Backflow can force wastes through a cross-connection. Several things can cause backflow:</p>

      </ul>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">When wastewater or other liquids are siphoned into the fresh water supply, they can cause contamination, sickness, and even death. Escherichia coli, also known as E. coli, and Legionella (the bacteria that causes Legionnaire’s disease) can be spread through backflow from contaminated systems. A safety device called a <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_backflow_preventer" type="dlentry">backflow preventer</term> keeps wastewater from entering the water supply system. You will learn more about backflow and backflow prevention later in the Plumbing curriculum.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">To prevent the spread of harmful organisms, chemicals, and materials through water supply systems, water is made safe through <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_disinfection" type="dlentry">disinfection</term>, <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_filtration" type="dlentry">filtration</term>, and <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_softening" type="dlentry">softening</term>. To disinfect water means to destroy harmful organisms in the water. Filtration is the process of cleansing water to remove particles and chemicals. Softening removes magnesium and sodium salts that cause scale on the inside of pipes and fittings. You will learn more about these methods of water treatment later in the Plumbing curriculum.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">The safety and health of the plumber is just as important as that of the customer. One of the dangers facing plumbers is injury caused by scalding. For many years, plumbing codes have usually required water to be available at temperatures of up to 140°F (60°C). The American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE) has found that this temperature is necessary to prevent the growth of Legionella bacteria. At this temperature, however, water can scald exposed skin almost immediately. In response to this danger, many codes include specific requirements to reduce the threat of scalding.</p>

         <title class="- topic/title " id="d1e2284">Low-Flow Fixtures</title>
         <p class="- topic/p ">As you have learned, one of the most important goals of the plumbing profession is to protect the health, safety, and comfort of the nation. Another important goal is to act as a steward of the environment. Water conservation is one of the most important environmental issues, and water-conserving fixtures, such as toilets and showerheads, help preserve this vital natural resource.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Toilets consume about 30 percent of the water in a typical household. In 1992, the federal government required that toilets installed in new and renovated plumbing systems use no more than 1.6 gallons per flush, or about half as much as older toilets. These low-flow toilets have since been followed by high-efficiency toilets that use as little as 1.28 or even 1.1 gallons per flush. Advocates of low-flow toilets claim that the water savings from low-flush toilets can save millions of gallons a year and extend the operating life of water treatment facilities. Waterless urinals use a cartridge filter containing a liquid seal rather than water to remove waste and odor. They are installed in locations where access to a water supply is difficult, or when water conservation considerations require their use.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">However, these fixtures must be properly sized and installed to work. When low-flow or high-efficiency toilets are connected to DWV systems that are designed for higher flow rates, the systems may clog and overflow, or they may require multiple flushes to empty the bowls, defeating the purpose of the fixture. The installation of low-flow fixtures may even require replacement of the sewer lines to accommodate the lower fluid flows—an expensive proposition. Contractors report that they receive more callbacks regarding low-flow toilets than for any other reason.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Always refer to your local code when installing plumbing fixtures. Read the manufacturer’s instructions and follow the installation instructions carefully. Getting the installation right the first time will help save the contractor time and money and will ensure satisfied customers.</p>

      </ul>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">During the underground rough-in phase, the plumber locates all supply and waste connections from the building systems to public utilities and establishes where these systems enter or leave the building. During the aboveground rough-in phase, the plumber cuts holes in walls, ceilings, or floors to attach or hang pipe for connection to fixtures. Then the plumber installs the pipe for the building’s various supply and waste systems. To join pipe runs, a plumber might use welding tools, soldering equipment, or special chemicals for plastic pipe. The plumber may operate power threading machines, propane torches, and other power tools during this phase.</p>
      </section>
      <note class="- topic/note ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Note</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Many plumbing terms are used interchangeably in some areas. Be sure you are using the terms the way they are typically used where you work.</p>
      </note>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Finally, in the finish phase, the plumber installs fixtures such as sinks, showers, and toilets, and appliances such as dishwashers, water purification systems, and water heaters. The plumber may be called upon to install the automatic controls that regulate pressurized pipe systems as well.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">During each of the three stages, you must ensure that the system is tight and safe. Do not let your customers discover leaks behind the walls after you have completed your work. Callbacks are expensive and can hurt your reputation as a professional.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Regardless of how well a plumbing system is installed, it must be maintained and periodically repaired. You could even think of service and maintenance as a fourth phase of a plumbing project. Plumbers perform a variety of tasks as part of service and maintenance, including the following:</p>

      </ul>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Additionally, plumbers must ensure that the drain, waste, and vent (DWV) system for each project is installed and working properly. DWV systems, which are discussed in greater depth later, are essential to protect public safety.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">Plumbing codes have grown increasingly comprehensive to accommodate new developments in technology and materials. Municipalities throughout the United States adopt ordinances based on suggested national plumbing standards, called <term class="- topic/term " href="#unique_6_Connect_42_model_codes" type="dlentry">model codes</term>. They often modify or interpret these model codes to reflect local conditions. For instance, a city that is prone to earthquakes, such as Los Angeles, would incorporate standards to protect installations from earthquake damage. Likewise, a city that is subject to flooding, such as Houston, would add special requirements to guard against contamination from floodwater.</p>
      </lcInstruction>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">The three primary model codes associated with plumbing are the International Plumbing Code (IPC), the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC), and the National Standard Plumbing Code (NSPC). You will learn how codes are developed and implemented later in the Plumbing curriculum.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Although model codes act as guidelines, municipal ordinances have the force of law. As an apprentice plumber, you need to know the applicable plumbing code that applies to the area where you work. Your local plumbing code covers the installation, alteration, repair, replacement, additions to, and use of plumbing systems. It establishes standards for many things, including the following:</p>

            of a plumbing business. Managers ensure that the right workers are being assigned to
            each task and are responsible for handling project finances. Large contracting firms may
            have several project managers.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Plumbing estimators work for contractors and building supply companies. They assess the
            materials and labor required to complete a project and contractors submit bids for jobs
            based on these estimates. Plumbing estimators must have a thorough understanding of
            construction methods as well as knowledge of the availability and prices of materials
            and supplies.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Plumbing estimators are experienced plumbers with superior mathematical abilities and
            the patience to prepare detailed, accurate estimates. Today’s estimators also need solid
            computer skills. Estimators have a great deal of responsibility, because errors in
            estimates can cost the contractor significant amounts of money. Depending on the size
            and type of the business, the estimating job may also be done by the contractor or the
            project manager.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">Construction contractors and owners establish and run contracting businesses. Typically,
            they hire apprentices, journey plumbers, and master plumbers. Depending on the size of
            their business, contractors may work with the crew or may manage the business full-time.
            Small contractors may have only one or two employees who manage the business, prepare
            estimates, obtain supplies, and perform the actual contracted work. Subcontractors and
            contractors/owners may specialize in installing particular systems, such as sprinkler
            systems, high-pressure pipe systems, or municipal water-treatment facilities.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Plumbing inspectors may work for a contractor or for a municipal jurisdiction such as a
            local or state government. Inspectors ensure that all plumbing installations follow
            applicable codes and quality requirements. Plumbing inspectors review and approve work
            at various stages of construction, depending on the installation.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Plumbing instructors train apprentices to become the next generation of journey and
            master plumbers, managers, inspectors, and engineers. Many dedicated and experienced
            plumbers find that becoming an instructor is a natural evolution in their career. Master
            plumbers often become instructors as their careers progress.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">No matter what career path you choose, you will be embarking on a lifelong learning
            process. Effective plumbers along any career path need to keep up-to-date with new
            tools, materials, and methods. If you choose to become a manager or if you intend to
            start your own construction business someday, you will need to learn the appropriate
            skills and continue to hone your skills as a plumber.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Apprenticeship is your first step down an exciting and challenging career path.
            Remember, every successful manager and business owner started as an apprentice.
            Successful plumbers have at least one thing in common: a willingness to keep on
            learning. That process of learning begins with apprentice training.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">The Department of Labor’s Office of Apprenticeship sets the minimum standards for training programs across the country. Office of Apprenticeship programs rely on mandatory classroom instruction and OJL. Office of Apprenticeship requires 144 hours of classroom instruction per year and 2,000 hours of OJL per year. In a typical Office of Apprenticeship program, trainees spend 576 hours in classroom instruction and 8,000 hours in OJL before receiving journey plumber certificates.</p>
      </lcInstruction>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">To address the training needs of the professional communities, NCCER developed a four-year plumbing training program. NCCER uses the minimum Office of Apprenticeship standards as a foundation for comprehensive curricula that provide trainees with in-depth classroom and OJL experience.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">The primary goal of NCCER is to standardize construction craft training throughout the country so that employers and employees benefit from it, no matter where they are located. As a trainee in an NCCER program, you receive benefits to help you prepare for your career in the plumbing profession. You will become part of the National Registry. You will receive a certificate for each level of training you complete. If you apply for a job with any participating contractor in the country, a transcript of your training will be available for that contractor to help verify your qualifications. If your training is incomplete when you make a job transfer, you can pick up where you left off, because every participating training center is using the same program. Many technical schools and colleges also use this program.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">The NCCER Plumbing curriculum provides trainees with industry-driven training and education. It adopts a purely competency-based teaching philosophy. This means that trainees must demonstrate to the instructor that they possess the understanding and the skills necessary to complete the tasks that are covered in each module before they can advance to the next stage of the curriculum.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">When the instructor is satisfied that a trainee has successfully demonstrated the required knowledge and skills for a particular module, test scores and completion information are sent to NCCER and kept in the National Registry. The National Registry can then confirm training and skills for workers as they move from state to state, company to company, or even within a company (see Appendix B).</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Whether you enroll in an NCCER program or another Office of Apprenticeship -approved program, ensure that you work for an employer or sponsor who supports a nationally standardized training program that includes credentials to confirm your skill development.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">A good apprenticeship program effectively combines competency-based, hands-on training with classroom instruction. This combination is the most effective way for a beginning plumber to learn and advance through the plumbing profession. Successful apprentices will develop the skills and knowledge they need to carry out a wide range of tasks.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">If you possess these professional and personal skills, you can become a top-notch, highly productive journey plumber. Journey plumbers have successfully completed an apprenticeship-training program. The term comes from the fifteenth-century word journeyman. Journeymen were apprentices who left their masters after learning their craft and worked alone or for someone else.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Successful journey plumbers who practice their craft with pride and skill are valued employees and co-workers. Once you have mastered the professional and personal skills necessary, you will be a good candidate to advance to an exciting and challenging career as a master plumber, superintendent plumber, plumbing supervisor, instructor, inspector, project manager, or contractor and business owner.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">The concept of apprenticeship training goes back thousands of years. Over that time, the basic principles of apprenticeship training have not changed. Apprentices learn their craft from those who have mastered it. Although some theory is presented in the classroom, it is always presented in a way that helps trainees understand the purpose behind the skill to be learned. The NCCER training curriculum follows this proven approach.</p>

      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">Youth Apprenticeship Programs allow students to begin their apprentice training while they are still in high school. Students entering a plumbing program in the 11th grade may complete as much as one year of the NCCER four-year program by their high school graduation. In addition, the program, in cooperation with local craft employers, allows students to work in the trade and earn money while they are still in school.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">This training program is similar to the one used by NCCER-accredited training sponsors across the country. With your official transcripts, you can enter the second year of the program wherever it is offered. You may also apply these credits to a two- or four-year college that offers degree or certificate programs in the construction profession.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">You may become an employee at age 16, but the US Department of Labor (DOL) limits your work to occupations that are not specifically defined as hazardous. Hazardous jobs include such things as explosives manufacturing, mining, meatpacking, and power-driven sheet metal work. You may work on a project site as an apprentice or journey plumber when you are 16, but only if you are enrolled and in good standing in a plumbing apprenticeship program.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">You must be at least 18 before you can legally work in a hazardous occupation. When you have graduated from your apprenticeship program, you can enter the industry at a higher level and with more pay than people who are just starting the apprenticeship program.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">All apprenticeship standards call for certain work-related training, or OJL. OJL is broken down into specific tasks in which the apprentice receives hands-on training. Each task requires a specified number of hours. The total number of hours in a plumbing apprenticeship is traditionally 8,000, which amounts to four years of training. In a competency-based program, this time may be shortened by testing out of specific tasks through a series of performance exams.</p>
      </lcInstruction>
      <section class="- topic/section ">
         <p class="- topic/p ">In a traditional program, you may complete the required OJL at the rate of 2,000 hours per year. If you are laid off or get sick, it may take longer.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Sponsors need to receive, log in, and report an apprentice’s time records, and have them reviewed by the federal government and/or the state apprenticeship program. Therefore, apprentices should keep accurate and up-to-date time records; after the first 144 classroom hours and 1,000 hours of related work, and then for each subsequent 1,000 hours, the standards entitle an apprentice to a pay increase.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Apprentices may not always receive classroom instruction and OJL at the same time. Apprentices with special job experience or other coursework may obtain credit toward their classroom requirements. This reduces the time they are required to spend in the classroom while meeting the 8,000-hour OJL requirement. These special cases depend on the type of program and its regulations and standards.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">For those entering an apprenticeship program, a high school or technical school education is desirable, with courses in plumbing, shop, mechanical drawing, and general mathematics. Manual dexterity, good physical condition, and a good sense of balance are important. It is essential to be able to solve math problems quickly and accurately and to work closely with others.</p>

         <p class="- topic/p ">History has taught us that plumbing is vital to public health, safety, and comfort. Today, the plumbing profession is more important than ever. As the world’s population grows, the built environment is expanding to accommodate it. The world needs more skilled and experienced plumbers to ensure that the public stays safe, healthy, and comfortable.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">The plumbing profession relies upon a range of skills and a broad base of knowledge. Plumbers are responsible for installing and maintaining a wide variety of supply and drainage systems. Plumbers carefully follow local codes and regulations to ensure that systems are safe.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">Because the plumbing profession is always evolving, successful plumbers never stop learning about new techniques, materials, tools, and standards. In addition to staying current with their technical skills and knowledge, successful plumbers also follow high ethical standards. They maintain a positive attitude, are honest and loyal, and are responsible for their actions. They cooperate with their teammates and supervisors, pay attention to rules and regulations, and are always prompt and reliable employees.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p ">As an apprentice embarking on your plumbing career, you have the right to expect a quality education that serves you well. Your employer or sponsor and your Apprenticeship Committee should do their best to ensure that you are well prepared for the responsibilities you will take on. Ultimately, though, the decision is yours as to whether you will try hard to become the best professional plumber that you can be.</p>
