Rules and regulations exist to keep people safe and to keep a project on schedule. Companies establish rules pertaining to work times, administrative issues, and professional conduct. Local, state, and federal authorities develop regulations that apply to a wide range of issues, including safety and health, materials, tools and equipment, and legal issues.</p>

Rules and regulations are necessary in any work situation. The rules might vary from employer to employer, so it is important to make sure you understand your employer’s or sponsor’s regulations each time you start a new job.</p>
