As a professional plumber, however, your responsibility will extend beyond assigned tasks. You should be able to see what needs to be done and do it without having to be asked. Your supervisor expects you to do the work well without being asked twice. Assuming responsibility makes a favorable impression on an employer/sponsor.</p>

Do not make excuses or blame others when you make an error. Doing so will cause people to distrust you and lose respect for you. If that happens, the quality of your work, and that of everyone who works with you, will suffer.</p>
