            <p class="p">The construction industry employs more people and contributes more to the nation’s
               economy than any other industry. Our society will always need people to build new homes,
               roads, airports, hospitals, schools, factories, and office buildings, maintain existing
               structures, and replace old and damaged ones. This means there will always be a source
               of well-paying jobs and career opportunities for construction trade professionals,
               including plumbers. Both large and small contracting firms employ plumbers. Plumbers who
               master the principles of small-business management and develop and hone their
               entrepreneurial skills can be self-employed.
            </p>

         <div class="section">
            
            <p class="p">Plumbers can choose from a number of career paths depending on their skills and
               interests (see <a href="M01_topic_3_2.xhtml#M01_topic_3_2__M01_02101-18_TG-figure3" class="xref">Figure 3</a>).
               Where you go depends on the pride and professionalism you show in your work. How well
               you succeed depends on your willingness to develop your skills and obtain the right
               training. With time and experience, plumbers progress from apprentices to one or more
               different specialties. These are some of the many positions and careers in the plumbing
               profession. Note that the career paths shown in <a href="M01_topic_3_2.xhtml#M01_topic_3_2__M01_02101-18_TG-figure3" class="xref">Figure 3</a> are examples; your path

         <div class="section">
            
            <p class="p">An apprentice is someone who is learning the plumbing trade. As you have learned, when a
               plumber successfully completes an apprenticeship, he or she becomes a journey plumber.
               Journey plumbers can remain at that level or advance in the profession. Journey plumbers
               might supervise less experienced plumbers or be called on to estimate the materials and
               labor for a specific job. With larger companies and on larger jobs, journey plumbers
               often become specialists.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Foremen are leaders who direct a single team of apprentices and/or journey plumbers.
               Large construction projects with more than one team require supervisors who oversee the
               work of all teams. They are responsible for assigning, directing, and inspecting the
               work of each team.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">A master craftsman is someone who consistently demonstrates the highest level of skill
               at a profession. Master plumbers are proven experts in the plumbing profession. They can
               act as mentors and teachers to less experienced members of the profession. Master
               plumbers often start their own businesses, no matter what role they play.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">The safety manager is another key, on-site person. Safety managers are responsible for
               the safety and health of the workers on a project. They are responsible for developing a
               safety plan and procedures, training workers in safety procedures, and ensuring that the
               project is in compliance with applicable health and safety regulations.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Project managers, often called project administrators, control the scope and direction
               of a plumbing business. Managers ensure that the right workers are being assigned to
               each task and are responsible for handling project finances. Large contracting firms may
               have several project managers.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Plumbing estimators work for contractors and building supply companies. They assess the
               materials and labor required to complete a project and contractors submit bids for jobs
               based on these estimates. Plumbing estimators must have a thorough understanding of
               construction methods as well as knowledge of the availability and prices of materials
               and supplies.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Plumbing estimators are experienced plumbers with superior mathematical abilities and
               the patience to prepare detailed, accurate estimates. Today’s estimators also need solid
               computer skills. Estimators have a great deal of responsibility, because errors in
               estimates can cost the contractor significant amounts of money. Depending on the size
               and type of the business, the estimating job may also be done by the contractor or the
               project manager.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Mechanical engineers research, develop, design, manufacture, and test a wide range of
               mechanical devices, including the following:

            <p class="p">Construction contractors and owners establish and run contracting businesses. Typically,
               they hire apprentices, journey plumbers, and master plumbers. Depending on the size of
               their business, contractors may work with the crew or may manage the business full-time.
               Small contractors may have only one or two employees who manage the business, prepare
               estimates, obtain supplies, and perform the actual contracted work. Subcontractors and
               contractors/owners may specialize in installing particular systems, such as sprinkler
               systems, high-pressure pipe systems, or municipal water-treatment facilities.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Plumbing inspectors may work for a contractor or for a municipal jurisdiction such as a
               local or state government. Inspectors ensure that all plumbing installations follow
               applicable codes and quality requirements. Plumbing inspectors review and approve work
               at various stages of construction, depending on the installation.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Plumbing instructors train apprentices to become the next generation of journey and
               master plumbers, managers, inspectors, and engineers. Many dedicated and experienced
               plumbers find that becoming an instructor is a natural evolution in their career. Master
               plumbers often become instructors as their careers progress.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">No matter what career path you choose, you will be embarking on a lifelong learning
               process. Effective plumbers along any career path need to keep up-to-date with new
               tools, materials, and methods. If you choose to become a manager or if you intend to
               start your own construction business someday, you will need to learn the appropriate
               skills and continue to hone your skills as a plumber.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Apprenticeship is your first step down an exciting and challenging career path.
               Remember, every successful manager and business owner started as an apprentice.
               Successful plumbers have at least one thing in common: a willingness to keep on
               learning. That process of learning begins with apprentice training.
