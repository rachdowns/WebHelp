            <p class="p">Once the Apprenticeship Committee selects an applicant to be an apprentice, the employer or sponsor hires the apprentice.
               The apprentice’s job has the same potential for career advancement as a non-apprentice employee. In return, the employer or
               sponsor requires the apprentice to make satisfactory progress in OJL and related classroom instruction throughout the duration
               of the apprenticeship program.

               or sponsor may also pay a share of the cost of operating the apprenticeship program.
