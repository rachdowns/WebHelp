            <p class="p">As a plumber, you will probably work with other people as part of a team. Every day, you interact with members of your work
               crew and with your supervisor. The ability to cooperate with your teammates is an important skill in the construction industry,
               but simply working and playing well with others is not enough. The success of any team depends on all of its members doing
               their parts. Everyone must contribute to the team to ensure that it achieves its goals. Such cooperation will help get projects
               done on time and on budget.
