Over that time, the basic principles of apprenticeship training have not changed. Apprentices learn their craft from those who have mastered it. Although some theory is presented in the classroom, it is always presented in a way that helps trainees understand the purpose behind the skill to be learned. The NCCER training curriculum follows this proven approach.</p>

Students entering a plumbing program in the 11th grade may complete as much as one year of the NCCER four-year program by their high school graduation. In addition, the program, in cooperation with local craft employers, allows students to work in the trade and earn money while they are still in school.</p>

With your official transcripts, you can enter the second year of the program wherever it is offered. You may also apply these credits to a two- or four-year college that offers degree or certificate programs in the construction profession.</p>

Hazardous jobs include such things as explosives manufacturing, mining, meatpacking, and power-driven sheet metal work. You may work on a project site as an apprentice or journey plumber when you are 16, but only if you are enrolled and in good standing in a plumbing apprenticeship program.</p>

When you have graduated from your apprenticeship program, you can enter the industry at a higher level and with more pay than people who are just starting the apprenticeship program.</p>
