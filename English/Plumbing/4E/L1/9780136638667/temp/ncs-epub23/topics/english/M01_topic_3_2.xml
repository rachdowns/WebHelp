            economy than any other industry. Our society will always need people to build new homes,
            roads, airports, hospitals, schools, factories, and office buildings, maintain existing
            structures, and replace old and damaged ones. This means there will always be a source
            of well-paying jobs and career opportunities for construction trade professionals,
            including plumbers. Both large and small contracting firms employ plumbers. Plumbers who
            master the principles of small-business management and develop and hone their
            entrepreneurial skills can be self-employed.</p>

            plumber successfully completes an apprenticeship, he or she becomes a journey plumber.
            Journey plumbers can remain at that level or advance in the profession. Journey plumbers
            might supervise less experienced plumbers or be called on to estimate the materials and
            labor for a specific job. With larger companies and on larger jobs, journey plumbers
            often become specialists.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_3_2.xml" xtrc="p:4;38:13">Foremen are leaders who direct a single team of apprentices and/or journey plumbers.
            Large construction projects with more than one team require supervisors who oversee the
            work of all teams. They are responsible for assigning, directing, and inspecting the
            work of each team.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_3_2.xml" xtrc="p:5;42:13">A master craftsman is someone who consistently demonstrates the highest level of skill
            at a profession. Master plumbers are proven experts in the plumbing profession. They can
            act as mentors and teachers to less experienced members of the profession. Master
            plumbers often start their own businesses, no matter what role they play.</p>

            the safety and health of the workers on a project. They are responsible for developing a
            safety plan and procedures, training workers in safety procedures, and ensuring that the
            project is in compliance with applicable health and safety regulations.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_3_2.xml" xtrc="p:7;50:13">Project managers, often called project administrators, control the scope and direction
            of a plumbing business. Managers ensure that the right workers are being assigned to
            each task and are responsible for handling project finances. Large contracting firms may
            have several project managers.</p>

            materials and labor required to complete a project and contractors submit bids for jobs
            based on these estimates. Plumbing estimators must have a thorough understanding of
            construction methods as well as knowledge of the availability and prices of materials
            and supplies.</p>

            the patience to prepare detailed, accurate estimates. Today’s estimators also need solid
            computer skills. Estimators have a great deal of responsibility, because errors in
            estimates can cost the contractor significant amounts of money. Depending on the size
            and type of the business, the estimating job may also be done by the contractor or the
            project manager.</p>

            they hire apprentices, journey plumbers, and master plumbers. Depending on the size of
            their business, contractors may work with the crew or may manage the business full-time.
            Small contractors may have only one or two employees who manage the business, prepare
            estimates, obtain supplies, and perform the actual contracted work. Subcontractors and
            contractors/owners may specialize in installing particular systems, such as sprinkler
            systems, high-pressure pipe systems, or municipal water-treatment facilities.</p>

            local or state government. Inspectors ensure that all plumbing installations follow
            applicable codes and quality requirements. Plumbing inspectors review and approve work
            at various stages of construction, depending on the installation.</p>

            master plumbers, managers, inspectors, and engineers. Many dedicated and experienced
            plumbers find that becoming an instructor is a natural evolution in their career. Master
            plumbers often become instructors as their careers progress.</p>

            process. Effective plumbers along any career path need to keep up-to-date with new
            tools, materials, and methods. If you choose to become a manager or if you intend to
            start your own construction business someday, you will need to learn the appropriate
            skills and continue to hone your skills as a plumber.</p>

            Remember, every successful manager and business owner started as an apprentice.
            Successful plumbers have at least one thing in common: a willingness to keep on
            learning. That process of learning begins with apprentice training.</p>
