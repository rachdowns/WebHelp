               do otherwise. Do not sacrifice your principles because it seems easier. Be fair and just in all dealings. Do not take undue
               advantage of another’s mistakes or difficulties. Fair people are open-minded and committed to justice, equal treatment of
               individuals, and tolerance for and acceptance of diversity. Be courteous and treat all people with equal respect and dignity.
               Abide by laws, rules, and regulations relating to all personal and business activities.
