            <p class="p">Plumbing codes have grown increasingly comprehensive to accommodate new developments in technology and materials. Municipalities
               throughout the United States adopt ordinances based on suggested national plumbing standards, called <a href="M01_topic_4_4_1.xhtml#M01_topic_4_4_1__model_codes"><dfn class="term">model codes</dfn></a>. They often modify or interpret these model codes to reflect local conditions. For instance, a city that is prone to earthquakes,
               such as Los Angeles, would incorporate standards to protect installations from earthquake damage. Likewise, a city that is
               subject to flooding, such as Houston, would add special requirements to guard against contamination from floodwater.

         <div class="section">
            
            <p class="p">The three primary model codes associated with plumbing are the International Plumbing Code (IPC), the Uniform Plumbing Code
               (UPC), and the National Standard Plumbing Code (NSPC). You will learn how codes are developed and implemented later in the
               Plumbing curriculum.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Although model codes act as guidelines, municipal ordinances have the force of law. As an apprentice plumber, you need to
               know the applicable plumbing code that applies to the area where you work. Your local plumbing code covers the installation,
               alteration, repair, replacement, additions to, and use of plumbing systems. It establishes standards for many things, including
               the following:
