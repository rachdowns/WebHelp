            <p class="p">Successful plumbers must be flexible enough to adapt their methods of working to the
               particular needs of each job. As you gain experience as a plumber, you will develop the
               flexibility necessary to meet changing job requirements. You will also improve your
               knowledge of the different tools and materials needed to accomplish certain jobs, and
               you will learn more about the technologies and methods that are available. Over time,
               you will improve your ability to do your job on time, on budget, and to the satisfaction
               of your customers. Satisfied customers mean repeat business.

            <p class="p">Keep current with the latest methods, materials, and equipment in the plumbing
               profession. This knowledge will help you and the company you work for stay competitive.
               You should never stop learning. When you complete your apprenticeship, you will simply
               be moving into a bigger classroom: the world.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p">Never take chances with your own safety or the safety of others. Always demonstrate a
               high level of professionalism. Remember, you are part of a proud heritage, and you
               represent a profession that is vital to modern society. As a plumber, you will want your
               customers to think well not only of your work as an individual, but also of the
               profession in general.

               that guide conduct. As a plumber, you are responsible for understanding and following
               the code of ethics for your chosen profession. <a href="M01_topic_4_3.xhtml" class="xref">Appendix A</a> lists the ethical principles
               that are followed by members of the construction trades.
