            <p class="p">A good plumber never stops learning. New machines, tools, materials, and methods are constantly being introduced. Even experienced
               plumbers need to be willing to learn about these advancements. If you keep your methods and tools up-to-date, your company
               will be able to use your skills to compete successfully with other companies. The better a company competes, the more profit
               it makes. The more profit the company makes, the more likely it is to stay in business, provide jobs, and raise salaries,
               all of which benefit you as an employee.

               are done where you work. You must be able to adapt to change and be willing to learn new methods and procedures as quickly
               as possible.
