            <p class="p">As a trainee, your primary responsibility is to do what is asked of you. As a professional plumber, however, your responsibility
               will extend beyond assigned tasks. You should be able to see what needs to be done and do it without having to be asked. Your
               supervisor expects you to do the work well without being asked twice. Assuming responsibility makes a favorable impression
               on an employer/sponsor.

            <p class="p">Always take responsibility for your actions, including any work done under your supervision. Do not make excuses or blame
               others when you make an error. Doing so will cause people to distrust you and lose respect for you. If that happens, the quality
               of your work, and that of everyone who works with you, will suffer.
