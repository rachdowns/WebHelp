Laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Drinking Water Act have been passed to develop programs to help ensure the enforcement of these rules and regulations. State and local health agencies also establish their own complementary standards and regulations that apply to their jurisdictions. A plumber’s responsibility is to follow all of the rules and safeguards related to the work. Plumbers should also report any accidents or events that may be hazardous to health or to the environment.</p>

One of the dangers facing plumbers is injury caused by scalding. For many years, plumbing codes have usually required water to be available at temperatures of up to 140°F (60°C). The American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE) has found that this temperature is necessary to prevent the growth of Legionella bacteria. At this temperature, however, water can scald exposed skin almost immediately. In response to this danger, many codes include specific requirements to reduce the threat of scalding.</p>

Another important goal is to act as a steward of the environment. Water conservation is one of the most important environmental issues, and water-conserving fixtures, such as toilets and showerheads, help preserve this vital natural resource.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_2_2_3.xml" xtrc="p:16;47:13">Toilets consume about 30 percent of the water in a typical household. In 1992, the federal government required that toilets installed in new and renovated plumbing systems use no more than 1.6 gallons per flush, or about half as much as older toilets. These low-flow toilets have since been followed by high-efficiency toilets that use as little as 1.28 or even 1.1 gallons per flush. Advocates of low-flow toilets claim that the water savings from low-flush toilets can save millions of gallons a year and extend the operating life of water treatment facilities. Waterless urinals use a cartridge filter containing a liquid seal rather than water to remove waste and odor. They are installed in locations where access to a water supply is difficult, or when water conservation considerations require their use.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_2_2_3.xml" xtrc="p:17;48:13">However, these fixtures must be properly sized and installed to work. When low-flow or high-efficiency toilets are connected to DWV systems that are designed for higher flow rates, the systems may clog and overflow, or they may require multiple flushes to empty the bowls, defeating the purpose of the fixture. The installation of low-flow fixtures may even require replacement of the sewer lines to accommodate the lower fluid flows—an expensive proposition. Contractors report that they receive more callbacks regarding low-flow toilets than for any other reason.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_2_2_3.xml" xtrc="p:18;49:13">Always refer to your local code when installing plumbing fixtures. Read the manufacturer’s instructions and follow the installation instructions carefully. Getting the installation right the first time will help save the contractor time and money and will ensure satisfied customers.</p>
