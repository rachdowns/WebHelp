Nevertheless, you should take the time to find a program that will train you well.</p>

      <section class="- topic/section " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_3_2_5.xml" xtrc="section:1;10:16">

The employer’s training program should be comprehensive, standardized, and based on developing and demonstrating competencies, not just on the amount of time you spend in a classroom. Before you enroll in a training program, find out how many employers in the area use the same program. The training program should have a well-defined compensation ladder so that your pay will increase in recognition of your new skills and experience.</p>
         <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/Users/gpage/Documents/Content/ncs_content/9780130210100/topics/english/M01_topic_3_2_5.xml" xtrc="p:3;12:13">The program should be nationally recognized and should provide you with transcripts and completion credentials. As an employee in the construction profession, you may end up working for several different contractors over the course of your career. Contractors in other cities and states must be able to recognize the experience and qualifications that you obtained through your training program.</p>

The curriculum should feature the latest developments in plumbing techniques, materials, tools, and equipment. The program should also take advantage of modern interactive training technology, such as multimedia tools and the Internet. As a plumber, you know how important it is to stay current; the same applies to training programs.</p>
